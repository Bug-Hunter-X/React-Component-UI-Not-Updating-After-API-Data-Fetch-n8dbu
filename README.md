# React Component UI Not Updating After API Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React applications where the UI fails to update after fetching data from an API.  The component fetches data successfully, but the changes are not reflected in the UI.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy component.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description:
The component fetches data from a mock API endpoint.  Despite a successful fetch and data being received, the UI does not update to display the fetched data.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring that React re-renders the component when the data changes.  This can be achieved by ensuring that the data used to render the UI is directly dependent on the state variable holding the fetched data.  Specifically, the JSON.stringify(data) might prevent React from detecting updates if the data structure doesn't change identically between renders.  A key strategy is making sure changes to the state are detected as distinct changes by React's change detection mechanisms.  It's sometimes necessary to create a new object or array with updated data instead of modifying an existing object/array in place.
